Article 1: UK house prices dip in November
Summary:
In November, UK average house prices dipped slightly to £180,226 from £180,444 in October, according to the ODPM, indicating a slowing housing market following interest rate hikes. Despite the monthly decline, annual house price inflation remained robust at 13.8%, though economists predict this growth will weaken in 2005. Mortgage approvals have reached a decade low, and while the Halifax reported a 1.1% monthly increase in December, it forecasts a 2% price drop for 2005. The ODPM attributed November's fall to decreases in detached house and flat values, with England having the highest average at £192,713, followed by London at £262,825. Annual inflation rates varied regionally, with the North East leading at 26.2%, while Northern Ireland and the West Midlands saw no change.

Article 2: LSE 'sets date for takeover deal'
Summary:
The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is expected to announce a preferred takeover partner by month-end, with both Deutsche Boerse and Euronext having held talks. Deutsche Boerse's £1.3bn offer was rejected, while Euronext is preparing a higher all-cash bid, possibly around £1.4bn. Deutsche Boerse's CEO, Werner Seifert, is reportedly growing impatient with the LSE's bid process, potentially opting to bypass the board and make a direct shareholder offer. Challenges to the takeover include job relocation concerns in Frankfurt, political opposition in Germany, and fears of monopolistic control over Clearstream, the securities transaction clearing house, which could negatively impact LSE shareholders. The LSE is set to have further discussions with both suitors this week.

Article 3: Harinordoquy suffers France axe
Summary:
Imanol Harinordoquy has been left out of France's 22-man squad for the upcoming Six Nations match against Ireland on 12 March due to a disappointing performance in the previous game against Wales. Pascal Pape, recovering from an ankle sprain, and Ludovic Valbon, who recently played as a replacement against Scotland, are among those returning to the squad. France coach Bernard Laporte emphasized the need for a strong performance in Dublin to maintain their chances of retaining the Six Nations trophy, as Ireland remains unbeaten and aims for their first Grand Slam since 1948.

Article 4: Barclays shares up on merger talk
Summary:
Barclays UK bank shares increased by 1.3% on Monday after reports emerged that it had held merger discussions with US bank Wells Fargo in 2004. If combined, the two banks would form the world's fourth-largest financial institution, valued at $180bn. Barclays, with operations in over 60 countries, and Wells Fargo, with extensive retail and business banking services, reported strong financial performance recently. However, both banks have declined to comment on the speculation, and market traders remain skeptical about the likelihood of an actual merger occurring.

Article 5: Campaign 'cold calls' questioned
Summary:
In the run-up to the UK general election, Labour and Conservative parties are contacting millions of individuals who have signed up to the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) to avoid marketing calls, despite the TPS banning unsolicited sales and marketing calls. Both parties claim their calls are not marketing, as they focus on gauging voting intentions rather than promoting their campaigns. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) states that while surveys on voting intentions are permissible, callers must inform individuals if their personal data will be retained. The Liberal Democrats have urged the ICO to halt these calls, arguing they are illegal, citing evidence of "significant" such calls from local branches. The ICO's Phil Jones clarified that while checking voting intentions is generally allowed, encouraging support afterward might violate regulations, depending on the call script. Despite few complaints, the Lib Dems seek new guidelines to ensure consistent party behavior under the existing rules.
