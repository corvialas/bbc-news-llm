Article 1: UK house prices dip in November
Summary:
UK house prices saw a minor monthly decline in November, dropping to £180,226 from £180,444 in October, according to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM). Despite this, annual house price inflation remains robust at 13.8%, though economists predict a slowdown in growth for 2005 due to interest rate hikes and reduced mortgage approvals. The Halifax reported a 1.1% monthly increase in December, following a 2.8% rise in the second half of 2004 against a 15.1% annual growth in 2004. The ODPM attributed November's fall to decreased values of detached houses and flats, with regional variations showing the North East experiencing the highest annual inflation at 26.2%. Average prices varied by region, with London having the highest at £262,825.

Article 2: LSE 'sets date for takeover deal'
Summary:
The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is expected to announce a preferred suitor for a takeover by month-end, with Deutsche Boerse and Euronext as the main contenders. Deutsche Boerse's £1.3bn offer has been rejected, while Euronext is preparing a higher all-cash bid, potentially around £1.4bn. Deutsche Boerse's CEO, Werner Seifert, is reportedly growing impatient with the LSE's bid process and may bypass the board to make a direct shareholder offer. Additional concerns include job losses in Frankfurt, potential weakening of London's financial status, and monopolistic control over Clearstream, the securities transactions clearing house. The LSE is set to hold further talks with both parties this week amidst these challenges.

Article 3: Harinordoquy suffers France axe
Summary:
France's number eight Imanol Harinordoquy has been left out of the squad for their upcoming Six Nations match against Ireland on 12 March due to a poor performance in the recent loss to Wales. Bourgoin lock Pascal Pape returns to the squad after recovering from an ankle injury, while wing Cedric Heymans and Ludovic Valbon are included, replacing Aurelien Rougerie and Jean-Philippe Grandclaude. Coach Bernard Laporte emphasized the need for a strong, adaptable team to face Ireland, who are unbeaten and aiming for their first Grand Slam since 1948. France must win in Dublin to maintain their hopes of retaining the Six Nations trophy.

Article 4: Barclays shares up on merger talk
Summary:
Barclays UK bank shares increased by 1.3% on Monday after a report in the Sunday Express suggested merger talks with US bank Wells Fargo had taken place in 2004. If combined, the two banks would form the world's fourth-largest, valued at $180bn. However, Barclays has not commented on the speculation, and traders remain sceptical about the likelihood of an actual deal materializing. The report has revived takeover interest in Barclays, similar to speculation involving Citigroup in August, though no concrete offers have emerged.

Article 5: Campaign 'cold calls' questioned
Summary:
In the run-up to the UK general election, Labour and Conservative parties are contacting millions of individuals who have signed up to the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) to avoid marketing calls, despite the TPS banning unsolicited sales and marketing calls. Both parties claim their calls are not marketing, as they focus on gauging voting intentions rather than promoting their campaigns. However, the Liberal Democrats argue that these calls are illegal and have requested the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) to intervene. The ICO states that surveys on voting intentions are permissible but must be transparent about data usage. The controversy hinges on whether asking for voting support constitutes marketing, with the ICO noting that compliance depends on the specific scripts used. Despite receiving few complaints, the ICO is urged to clarify guidelines to ensure consistent party behavior under the existing regulations.
