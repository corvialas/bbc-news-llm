Article 1: UK house prices dip in November
Summary:
UK house prices saw a slight monthly dip in November, falling to £180,226 from October's £180,444, according to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM). Despite this, annual house price inflation remains robust at 13.8%, though economists predict a slowdown in growth for 2005. The decline is attributed to reduced activity in mortgage approvals and a decrease in the value of detached houses and flats. Regionally, the North East exhibited the highest annual inflation at 26.2%, while London, with the highest average price at £262,825, showed a milder increase to 7.1%. The Halifax reported a 1.1% monthly rise in December, following a 2.8% growth in the second half of 2004, forecasting a 2% fall in 2005 as the market stabilizes after significant gains.

Article 2: LSE 'sets date for takeover deal'
Summary:
The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is expected to announce a preferred suitor for a takeover by month's end, with both Deutsche Boerse and Euronext in contention. Deutsche Boerse's £1.3bn offer was previously rejected, while Euronext is reportedly preparing a £1.4bn all-cash bid. Deutsche Boerse's CEO, Werner Seifert, is growing impatient with the negotiation process, potentially taking his offer directly to LSE shareholders. Challenges to the takeover include job relocation concerns in Frankfurt, political opposition in Germany, and worries over monopolistic control of Clearstream, the securities transaction clearinghouse, which could negatively impact LSE shareholders. Despite these hurdles, the LSE is set to hold further talks with both potential buyers this week.

Article 3: Harinordoquy suffers France axe
Summary:
France's number eight Imanol Harinordoquy has been left out of the squad for their Six Nations match against Ireland on 12 March due to a poor performance in the recent loss to Wales. Bourgoin lock Pascal Pape, recovering from an ankle sprain, returns to the 22-man squad. Wing Cedric Heymans and Ludovic Valbon are included, replacing Aurelien Rougerie and Jean-Philippe Grandclaude. France coach Bernard Laporte emphasized the need for a strong, adaptable team for the tough encounter in Dublin, aiming to win and maintain their Six Nations trophy hopes, despite Ireland's unbeaten streak and Grand Slam ambitions.

Article 4: Barclays shares up on merger talk
Summary:
Barclays UK bank shares rose on Monday after a report in the Sunday Express suggested merger talks with US bank Wells Fargo had taken place in 2004. If combined, the banks would form the world's fourth-largest financial institution, valued at approximately $180 billion. However, Barclays has not commented on these speculations, and traders remain skeptical about the likelihood of a deal materializing. The potential merger has stirred interest given Barclays' recent takeover speculation involving Citigroup, though no concrete offers have emerged. Both banks have reported strong financial performances recently, with Barclays forecasting profit increases and Wells Fargo recording a 9% net income growth in its last financial year.

Article 5: Campaign 'cold calls' questioned
Summary:
In the run-up to the UK general election, Labour and Conservative parties are contacting millions of individuals who have signed up to the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) to avoid marketing calls, despite the TPS banning unsolicited sales and marketing calls. Both parties claim their calls are not marketing, as they focus on gauging voting intentions rather than promoting their campaigns, and assert they follow legal advice allowing such calls. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) states that surveys on voting intentions are permissible but emphasizes that individuals must be informed if their personal data is stored. The Liberal Democrats, however, argue these calls are illegal and have urged the ICO to intervene, citing evidence of "significant" such calls. The ICO's Phil Jones clarifies that while checking voting intentions is allowed, encouraging support for a party within these calls could breach regulations, depending on the script used. Complaints about these practices are currently few, but the Lib Dems seek new guidelines for consistent party behavior under the existing rules.
