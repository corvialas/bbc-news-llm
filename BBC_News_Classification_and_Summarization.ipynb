        "This project applies IBM's Granite 3.3 large language model (LLM) to automate the classification and summarization of BBC news articles. The focus is on executing two key natural language processing (NLP) tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Text Classification** — Predict the category of a news article (e.g., business, politics, sport).\n",
        "2. **Text Summarization** — Generate a short, informative summary (2–3 sentences) for each article.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Background and Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "As the volume of digital news continues to grow, there is an increasing demand for systems that can organize and distill information efficiently. Manual methods for classifying and summarizing articles are time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to scale.

        "\n",
        "This implementation utilizes a publicly available BBC News dataset and interacts with the IBM Granite 3.3 model through the Replicate API. The workflow includes the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Load and preprocess the dataset using Google Colab and KaggleHub.\n",
        "- Use prompt-based interaction with the IBM Granite model to:\n",
        "  - Classify each article into one of five predefined topical categories.\n",
        "  - Generate concise summaries for each article’s content.\n",
        "- Compare classification predictions against ground truth labels.\n",
        "- Tune prompt instructions and model parameters to improve output quality, following guidance from IBM Lab 1 and Lab 2.\n",

Athletics Kenya (AK) issued the ban after Chepkemei failed to turn up for a cross country training camp in Embu. \\\"We have banned her from all local and international competitions,\\\" said AK chief Isaiah Kiplagat. \\\"We shall communicate this decision to the IAAF and all meet directors all over the world.\\\" The 29-year-old finished second to Paula Radcliffe in the 2002 and 2003 London races, and was also edged out in an epic New York Marathon contest last year.  But the ban will prevent the two-time world half-marathon silver medallist from challenging Radcliffe at this year's London event in April. Global Sports Communications, Chepkemei's management company, said she had wanted to run in the World Cross Country Championships in March. But AK maintained it was making an example of Chepkemei as a warning to other Kenyan athletes. \\\"We are taking this action in order to salvage our pride,\\\" said Kiplagat. \\\"We have been accused of having no teeth to bite with and that agents are ruling over us.\\\" KA has also threatened three-time women's short-course champion Edith Masai with a similar ban if reports that she feigned injury to avoid running at the cross country world championships are true. Masai missed the national trials in early February, but was included in the provisional team on the proviso that she ran in a regional competition. She failed to run in the event, citing a leg injury. \",\n          \" The soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth, although world's major economies should weather the storm of price rises, according to the OECD.  In its latest bi-annual report, the OECD cut its growth predictions for the world's main industrialised regions. US growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the OECD said. However, the Paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum.  Forecasts for Japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% this year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005. But the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said. Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006. \\\"There are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future,\\\" said Jean-Philippe Cotis, the OECD's chief economist. The price of crude is about 50% higher than it was at the start of 2004, but down on the record high of $55.67 set in late October.  A dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said. \\\"The oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. If the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters,\\\" Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the BBC's World Business Report. \\\"The recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005.\\\" China's booming economy and a \\\"spectacular comeback\\\" in Japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery, the OECD said. \\\"Supported by strong balance sheets and high profits, the recovery of business investment should continue in North America and start in earnest in Europe,\\\" it added. However, the report warned: \\\"It remains to be seen whether continental Europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand.\\\" The OECD highlighted current depressed household expenditure in Germany and the eurozone's over-reliance on export-led growth. \",\n          \" Consumer electronics giants Hitachi and Matshushita Electric are joining forces to share and develop technology for flat screen televisions.  The tie-up comes as the world's top producers are having to contend with falling prices and intense competition. The two Japanese companies will collaborate in research & development, production, marketing and licensing. They said the agreement would enable the two companies to expand the plasma display TV market globally.  Plasma display panels are used for large, thin TVs which are replacing old-style televisions. The display market for high-definition televisions is split between models using plasma display panels and others - manufactured by the likes of Sony and Samsung - using liquid-crystal displays (LCDs). The deal will enable Hitachi and Matsushita, which makes Panasonic brand products, to develop new technology and improve their competitiveness. Hitachi recently announced a deal to buy plasma display technology from rival Fujitsu in an effort to strengthen its presence in the market.  Separately, Fujitsu announced on Monday that it is quitting the LCD panel market by transferring its operations in the area to Japanese manufacturer Sharp. Sharp will inherit staff, manufacturing facilities and intellectual property from Fujitsu. The plasma panel market has seen rapid consolidation in recent months as the price of consumer electronic goods and components has fallen. Samsung Electronics and Sony are among other companies working together to reduce costs and speed up new product development. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The e-mails show that they have come from an fbi.gov address and tell recipients that they have accessed illegal websites. The messages warn that their internet use has been monitored by the FBI's Internet Fraud Complaint Center. An attachment in the e-mail contains the virus, the FBI said. The message asks recipients to click on the attachment and answer some questions about their internet use. But rather than being a questionnaire, the attachment contains a virus that infects the recipient's computer, according to the agency. It is not clear what the virus does once it has infected a computer. Users are warned never to open attachment from unsolicited e-mails or from people they do not know.  \\\"Recipients of this or similar solicitations should know that the FBI does not engage in the practice of sending unsolicited e-mails to the public in this manner,\\\" the FBI said in a statement. The bureau is investigating the phoney e-mails. The agency earlier this month shut down fbi.gov accounts, used to communicate with the public, because of a security breach. A spokeswoman said the two incidents appear to be unrelated. \",\n          \" BT is introducing two initiatives to help beat rogue dialler scams, which can cost dial-up net users thousands.  From May, dial-up net users will be able to download free software to stop computers using numbers not on a user's \\\"pre-approved list\\\". Inadvertently downloaded by surfers, rogue diallers are programs which hijack modems and dial up a premium rate number when users log on. Thousands of UK dial-up users are believed to have been hit by the scam. Some people have faced phone bills of up to \\u00a32,000. BT's Modem Protection program will check numbers that are dialled by a computer and will block them if they have not been pre-approved, such as national and net service provider numbers. Icstis, the UK's premium rate services watchdog, said it had been looking for companies to take the lead in initiatives. \\\"The initiatives are very welcome,\\\" a spokesperson from Icstis told the BBC News website. \\\"We are very pleased to see they are putting into place new measures to protect consumers.\\\"  The second initiative BT announced is an early warning system which will alert BT customers if there is unusual activity on their phone bills. If a bill rises substantially above its usual daily average, or if a call is made to a suspect number, a text or voice alert will be sent to the user's landline phone. As part of the clamp-down on rogue diallers, companies must now satisfy stringent conditions, including clear terms and conditions, information about how to delete diallers and responsibility for customer refunds. Any firm running a dialler without permission can now be closed down by Icstis. The watchdog brought in the action last October following a decision to license all companies which wanted to operate legitimate premium rate dialler services.  There are legitimate companies who offer services such as adult content, sports results and music downloads by charging a premium rate rather than by credit card BT said it had ploughed an enormous amount of effort into protecting people from the problem. It has already barred more than 1,000 premium rate numbers and has tried to raise public awareness about the scams. \\\"We now want to ensure there are even stronger safeguards for our customers, who we would urge to make use of these new options to protect themselves,\\\" said Gavin Patterson, group managing director for consumer the arm of BT. Both schemes have been undergoing trials in Ireland, and will be made available to 20 million BT customers from May. \",\n          \" The US dollar's slide against the euro and yen has halted after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said a strong dollar was \\\"in America's interest\\\".  But analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the US economy were still significant. They also pointed out that positive comments apart, President George W Bush's administration had done little to stop the dollar's slide. A weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit. The dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100GMT, still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 November. Against the Japanese yen, it was trading at 105.28 yen, after hitting a seven-month low of 105.17 earlier in the day.  Policy makers in Europe have called the dollar's slide \\\"brutal\\\" and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. However, it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euro's rise at a monthly meeting of Eurozone ministers late on Monday. Higher growth in Europe is regarded by US officials as a way the huge US current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced. Mr Snow who is currently in Dublin at the start of a four-nation EU visit, has applauded Ireland's introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth. \\\"The eurozone is growing below its potential. When a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners,\\\" he said. Mr Snow's comments may have helped shore up the dollar on Monday, but he was careful to qualify his statement.  \\\"Our basic policy, of course, is to let open, competitive markets set the values,\\\" he explained. \\\"Markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals.\\\" US officials have also said that other economies need to grow, so the US is not the main global growth engine. Economists say that the fundamentals, or key indicators, of the US economy are looking far from rosy. Domestic consumer demand is cooling, and heavy spending by President Bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record $427bn (\\u00a3230bn).

            "Summary:\n",
            "In November, UK house prices dipped slightly to £180,226 from £180,444 in October, according to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM). Despite the monthly decline, annual house price inflation remained robust at 13.8%, though economists predict a slowdown in growth for 2005. The fall in November prices is attributed to decreases in detached house and flat values, with regional variations showing the North East with the highest annual inflation at 26.2%. Meanwhile, mortgage approvals have fallen to a near-decade low, and the Halifax reported a 1.1% monthly house price increase in December, following a 2.8% rise in the second half of 2004 and a 15.1% annual gain for the whole of 2004. The Halifax forecasts a 2% price decline in 2005 as the market stabilizes. Average prices varied regionally, with London at £262,825 being the highest, and annual inflation increases were observed in most regions except Northern Ireland and the West Midlands.\n",

Deutsche Boerse's £1.3bn offer was previously rejected, while Euronext hints at a £1.4bn cash bid. Both parties are rumored to be preparing higher offers, with Deutsche Boerse potentially reaching £1.5bn. However, Deutsche Boerse's CEO, Werner Seifert, is reportedly growing impatient with the LSE's managed bid process and might bypass the board to make a direct shareholder offer. Additional concerns include job losses in Frankfurt, potential weakening of London's financial hub status, and the monopolistic control over Clearstream, which could disadvantage LSE shareholders in transaction fee negotiations. The LSE is set to hold further talks with both suitors this week.\n",

            "Barclays UK bank shares increased by 1.3% on Monday after a report in the Sunday Express suggested merger talks with US bank Wells Fargo had taken place in 2004. If combined, the two banks would form the world's fourth-largest bank, valued at $180bn. However, Barclays has not commented on the speculation, and market traders remain sceptical about the likelihood of an actual deal materializing. Barclays, with a history of over 300 years, has shown strong financial performance with predicted pre-tax profit increases, while Wells Fargo reported a 9% net income rise in its last financial year. Despite these positive indicators, the traders' consensus leans towards the talks being more of a routine exploratory discussion rather than a serious merger plan.\n",

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) states that while surveys on voting intentions are permissible, call recipients must be informed if their personal data is retained. The Liberal Democrats, however, argue that such calls are illegal and have urged the ICO to intervene, citing evidence of \"significant\" unlawful calls. The ICO emphasizes that the legality hinges on the script used and adherence to it, noting they receive few complaints on this issue.

        "\n",
        "This project demonstrated the effectiveness of IBM's Granite 3.3 large language model in performing two core natural language processing tasks: news article classification and summarization. Through prompt engineering, parameter tuning, and validation techniques, the model was able to classify articles into predefined categories with an accuracy around 80% and generate high-quality summaries within a controlled length.\n",
        "\n",
        "The classification task benefited significantly from enforcing one-word outputs and applying output validation, which reduced ambiguity and improved alignment with ground truth labels. Meanwhile, summarization performance improved after prompt refinement and parameter tuning, resulting in more concise and focused summaries that adhered to the expected 2–3 sentence format.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Recommendation**\n",
        "\n",
        "To further enhance model performance and usability:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Expand Label Granularity**: Consider introducing more nuanced or hierarchical categories to handle ambiguous or overlapping articles more effectively (e.g., splitting “entertainment” into “music,” “film,” etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Automate Output Validation**: Integrate label checking and post-processing pipelines to ensure robustness when scaling the classification task to larger datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Experiment with Few-Shot Prompting**: Incorporate labeled examples in the prompt to test whether the model can improve accuracy through in-context learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Apply Summarization to Large-Scale Data**: Use the tuned summarization settings to generate summaries across the full dataset and assess potential for real-world applications such as content tagging, indexing, or summarizing live news feeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Monitor Cost and Token Usage**: Since API usage incurs cost, consider batching inference or caching responses when scaling up to thousands of records.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, IBM Granite 3.3 shows strong capabilities in zero-shot classification and summarization tasks, especially when guided with well-crafted prompts and carefully tuned parameters. With minimal infrastructure, it enables scalable NLP experimentation directly from tools such as Google Colab.\n"
