        "1. **Text Classification** — Predict the category of a news article (e.g., business, politics, sport).\n",
        "2. **Text Summarization** — Generate a short, informative summary (2–3 sentences) for each article.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Background and Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "As the volume of digital news continues to grow, there is an increasing demand for systems that can organize and distill information efficiently. Manual methods for classifying and summarizing articles are time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as IBM Granite, provide a scalable solution for automating these tasks with high-quality language understanding and generation capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "This implementation utilizes a publicly available BBC News dataset and interacts with the IBM Granite 3.3 model through the Replicate API. The workflow includes the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Load and preprocess the dataset using Google Colab and KaggleHub.\n",
        "- Use prompt-based interaction with the IBM Granite model to:\n",
        "  - Classify each article into one of five predefined topical categories.\n",
        "  - Generate concise summaries for each article’s content.\n",
        "- Compare classification predictions against ground truth labels.\n",
        "- Tune prompt instructions and model parameters to improve output quality, following guidance from IBM Lab 1 and Lab 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Name**: BBC Articles Dataset  \n",
        "- **Source**: [Kaggle – jacopoferretti/bbc-articles-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacopoferretti/bbc-articles-dataset)  \n",
        "- **Format**: TSV file with the following columns:\n",
        "  - `category`: ground truth label\n",
        "  - `title`: headline of the article\n",
        "  - `content`: full article body text  \n",
        "- **Usage in this project**:\n",
        "  - `content` is used as input for both classification and summarization tasks.\n",
        "  - `category` is used as the target label to evaluate classification accuracy.\n",

Athletics Kenya (AK) issued the ban after Chepkemei failed to turn up for a cross country training camp in Embu. \\\"We have banned her from all local and international competitions,\\\" said AK chief Isaiah Kiplagat. \\\"We shall communicate this decision to the IAAF and all meet directors all over the world.\\\" The 29-year-old finished second to Paula Radcliffe in the 2002 and 2003 London races, and was also edged out in an epic New York Marathon contest last year.  But the ban will prevent the two-time world half-marathon silver medallist from challenging Radcliffe at this year's London event in April. Global Sports Communications, Chepkemei's management company, said she had wanted to run in the World Cross Country Championships in March. But AK maintained it was making an example of Chepkemei as a warning to other Kenyan athletes. \\\"We are taking this action in order to salvage our pride,\\\" said Kiplagat. \\\"We have been accused of having no teeth to bite with and that agents are ruling over us.\\\" KA has also threatened three-time women's short-course champion Edith Masai with a similar ban if reports that she feigned injury to avoid running at the cross country world championships are true. Masai missed the national trials in early February, but was included in the provisional team on the proviso that she ran in a regional competition. She failed to run in the event, citing a leg injury. \",\n          \" The soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth, although world's major economies should weather the storm of price rises, according to the OECD.  In its latest bi-annual report, the OECD cut its growth predictions for the world's main industrialised regions. US growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the OECD said. However, the Paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum.  Forecasts for Japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% this year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005. But the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said. Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006. \\\"There are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future,\\\" said Jean-Philippe Cotis, the OECD's chief economist. The price of crude is about 50% higher than it was at the start of 2004, but down on the record high of $55.67 set in late October.  A dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said. \\\"The oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. If the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters,\\\" Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the BBC's World Business Report. \\\"The recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005.\\\" China's booming economy and a \\\"spectacular comeback\\\" in Japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery, the OECD said. \\\"Supported by strong balance sheets and high profits, the recovery of business investment should continue in North America and start in earnest in Europe,\\\" it added. However, the report warned: \\\"It remains to be seen whether continental Europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand.\\\" The OECD highlighted current depressed household expenditure in Germany and the eurozone's over-reliance on export-led growth. \",\n          \" Consumer electronics giants Hitachi and Matshushita Electric are joining forces to share and develop technology for flat screen televisions.  The tie-up comes as the world's top producers are having to contend with falling prices and intense competition. The two Japanese companies will collaborate in research & development, production, marketing and licensing. They said the agreement would enable the two companies to expand the plasma display TV market globally.  Plasma display panels are used for large, thin TVs which are replacing old-style televisions. The display market for high-definition televisions is split between models using plasma display panels and others - manufactured by the likes of Sony and Samsung - using liquid-crystal displays (LCDs). The deal will enable Hitachi and Matsushita, which makes Panasonic brand products, to develop new technology and improve their competitiveness. Hitachi recently announced a deal to buy plasma display technology from rival Fujitsu in an effort to strengthen its presence in the market.  Separately, Fujitsu announced on Monday that it is quitting the LCD panel market by transferring its operations in the area to Japanese manufacturer Sharp. Sharp will inherit staff, manufacturing facilities and intellectual property from Fujitsu. The plasma panel market has seen rapid consolidation in recent months as the price of consumer electronic goods and components has fallen. Samsung Electronics and Sony are among other companies working together to reduce costs and speed up new product development. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The new President, Viktor Yushchenko, has said a \\\"limited\\\" list of companies is being drawn up. But on Wednesday Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms. The government says many privatised firms were sold to allies of the last administration at rock-bottom prices. More than 90,000 businesses in all, from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts, have been sold off since 1992, as the command economy built up when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union was dismantled.  Ms Tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than 3,000 businesses which were to be reviewed. \\\"We will return to the state that which was illegally put into private hands.\\\"  A day earlier, Mr Yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investors - had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted. The list \\\"will be limited and final, and will not be extended after its completion\\\", he said. An open-ended list could further damage outside investors' fragile faith in Ukraine, said Stuart Hensel of the Economist Intelligence Unit. But the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in Russia, Mr Hensel said. As a result, it was planning to resell rather than keep firms in state hands. \\\"They're aware of the need not to scare investors, and to be careful of internal divides within Ukraine,\\\" he said. \\\"They don't want to be seen to be transferring assets from one set of oligarchs to a new set.\\\" Foreign investment in Ukraine, at about $40 a head in 2004, is one of the lowest among ex-Soviet states.  Mr Yushchenko became president after two elections in December, the first of which was annulled amid allegations of voting irregularities and massive street protests.  His opponent, Viktor Yanukovich, still has huge support in the country's eastern industrial heartland. Mr Yushchenko's administration has accused its predecessor, led by ex-President Leonid Kuchma, of corruption. The privatisation review's number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included Viktor Pinchuk, Mr Kuchma's son-in-law, for $800m (\\u00a3424m) despite higher bids from several foreign groups. The mill, Krivorizhstal, is one of the world's most profitable. \\\"We say Krivorizhstal was stolen, and at any cost we will return it to the state,\\\" Mr Yushchenko told an investors' conference in Kiev.  One of the jilted bidders, Netherlands-based group LNM, said it welcomed the possibility that the mill might be back on the market.  \\\"If the original privatisation is annulled and a new tender issued, then we would look at it with great interest,\\\" a spokesman told BBC News. A resale of Krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Mr Hensel. But he warned that the government could decide to take the easy route of revaluing the company and charging the existing owners the revised price rather than undertaking a fresh sale. \\\"That way, Mr Yushchenko can go to the public and say he has forced the oligarchs to play by the rules,\\\" he told BBC News. \",\n          \" Growth in Japan evaporated in the three months to September, sparking renewed concern about an economy not long out of a decade-long trough.  Output in the period grew just 0.1%, an annual rate of 0.3%. Exports - the usual engine of recovery - faltered, while domestic demand stayed subdued and corporate investment also fell short. The growth falls well short of expectations, but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion.  The economy had stagnated throughout the 1990s, experiencing only brief spurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums. One result was deflation - prices falling rather than rising - which made Japanese shoppers cautious and kept them from spending.  The effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports for its recent recovery. But high oil prices have knocked 0.2% off the growth rate, while the falling dollar means products shipped to the US are becoming relatively more expensive.  The performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier in the year. The first quarter showed annual growth of 6.3%, with the second showing 1.1%, and economists had been predicting as much as 2% this time around. \\\"Exports slowed while capital spending became weaker,\\\" said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist at UBS Securities in Tokyo. \\\"Personal consumption looks good, but it was mainly due to temporary factors such as the Olympics. \\\"The amber light is flashing.\\\" The government may now find it more difficult to raise taxes, a policy it will have to implement when the economy picks up to help deal with Japan's massive public debt. \",\n          \" Israel has asked a US banker and former International Monetary Fund director to run its central bank.  Stanley Fischer, vice chairman of banking giant Citigroup, has agreed to take the Bank of Israel job subject to approval from parliament and cabinet. His nomination by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon came as a surprise, and led to gains on the Tel Aviv stock market. Mr Fischer, who speaks fluent Hebrew, will have to become an Israeli citizen to take the job. The US says he will not have to give up US citizenship to do so.  Previous incumbent David Klein, who often argued with the Finance Ministry, steps down on 16 January. Mr Fischer will face a delicate balancing act - both in political and economic terms - between Mr Sharon and finance minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who also backed his nomination. But his appointment has also raised hopes that it could bring in fresh investment - and perhaps even an improvement in the country's credit rating Mr Fischer first went to Israel for six months in 1973, and almost emigrated there before deciding finally to return to the US. While teaching at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology he spent a month seconded to the Bank of Israel in 1979, beginning a long-time involvement in studying Israel's economy. In 1983 Mr Fischer became adviser on Israel's economy to then-US secretary of state George Shultz. At the World Bank in 1985, he participated in drawing up an economic stabilisation package for Israel. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"true\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\",\n          \"entertainment\",\n          \"tech\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pred\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"unknown\",\n          \"business\",\n          \"sport\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "Summary:\n",
            "In November, UK average house prices dipped slightly to £180,226 from £180,444 in October, according to the ODPM, indicating a slowing housing market following interest rate hikes. Despite the monthly decline, annual house price inflation remained robust at 13.8%, though economists predict this growth will weaken in 2005. Mortgage approvals have reached a decade low, and while the Halifax reported a 1.1% monthly increase in December, it forecasts a 2% price drop for 2005. The ODPM attributed November's fall to decreases in detached house and flat values, with England having the highest average at £192,713, followed by London at £262,825. Annual inflation rates varied regionally, with the North East leading at 26.2%, while Northern Ireland and the West Midlands saw no change.\n",

Deutsche Boerse's £1.3bn offer was rejected, while Euronext is preparing a higher all-cash bid, possibly around £1.4bn. Deutsche Boerse's CEO, Werner Seifert, is reportedly growing impatient with the LSE's bid process, potentially opting to bypass the board and make a direct shareholder offer. Challenges to the takeover include job relocation concerns in Frankfurt, political opposition in Germany, and fears of monopolistic control over Clearstream, the securities transaction clearing house, which could negatively impact LSE shareholders.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) states that while surveys on voting intentions are permissible, callers must inform individuals if their personal data will be retained. The Liberal Democrats have urged the ICO to halt these calls, arguing they are illegal, citing evidence of \"significant\" such calls from local branches. The ICO's Phil Jones clarified that while checking voting intentions is generally allowed, encouraging support afterward might violate regulations, depending on the call script.

        "### **Conclusion**\n",
        "\n",
        "This project demonstrated the effectiveness of IBM's Granite 3.3 large language model in performing two core natural language processing tasks: news article classification and summarization. Through prompt engineering, parameter tuning, and validation techniques, the model was able to classify articles into predefined categories with an accuracy around 80% and generate high-quality summaries within a controlled length.\n",
        "\n",
        "The classification task benefited significantly from enforcing one-word outputs and applying output validation, which reduced ambiguity and improved alignment with ground truth labels. Meanwhile, summarization performance improved after prompt refinement and parameter tuning, resulting in more concise and focused summaries that adhered to the expected 2–3 sentence format.\n",

        "### **Recommendation**\n",
        "\n",
        "To further enhance model performance and usability:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Expand Label Granularity**: Consider introducing more nuanced or hierarchical categories to handle ambiguous or overlapping articles more effectively (e.g., splitting “entertainment” into “music,” “film,” etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Automate Output Validation**: Integrate label checking and post-processing pipelines to ensure robustness when scaling the classification task to larger datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Experiment with Few-Shot Prompting**: Incorporate labeled examples in the prompt to test whether the model can improve accuracy through in-context learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Apply Summarization to Large-Scale Data**: Use the tuned summarization settings to generate summaries across the full dataset and assess potential for real-world applications such as content tagging, indexing, or summarizing live news feeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Monitor Cost and Token Usage**: Since API usage incurs cost, consider batching inference or caching responses when scaling up to thousands of records.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, IBM Granite 3.3 shows strong capabilities in zero-shot classification and summarization tasks, especially when guided with well-crafted prompts and carefully tuned parameters. With minimal infrastructure, it enables scalable NLP experimentation directly from tools such as Google Colab.\n"

        "\n",
        "AI was used appropriately and clearly explained throughout the project. Specifically, a large language model (LLM), IBM Granite 3.3, was used for two key tasks: text classification and summarization of BBC news articles. The classification task involved predicting the topic category of each article, while the summarization task generated concise 2–3 sentence summaries. Prompt engineering and parameter tuning were applied to guide the model’s output, and validation was used to ensure accuracy and consistency. The use of AI in this project demonstrates a practical application of LLMs in automating natural language understanding."
